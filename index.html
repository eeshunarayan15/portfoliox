            <h3>HTML 5</h3>
            <p>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft)</p>

            <h3>CSS 3</h3>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used in web development to control
                 the presentation and layout of web pages. It is a stylesheet language that works alongside HTML
                  (Hypertext Markup Language) to define how elements on a web page should be displayed, including 
                  their fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning. CSS allows web developers to separate the structure
                   (HTML) and the visual design (CSS) of a web page, making it easier to maintain and update websites.</p>

            <h3>JAVA SCRIPT</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile and widely-used programming 
                language that is primarily used in web development but has applications in various
                 other domains as well. It is a core technology for building dynamic and interactive web 
                 applications. JavaScript allows you to add functionality, interactivity, and behavior to 
                 web pages, making them more responsive and engaging for users. </p>

            <h3>REACT JS</h3>
             <p>React.js, often simply referred to as React, 
                is a popular open-source JavaScript library
                
                for building user interfaces. It was developed and is
                 maintained by Facebook, and it is widely used for creating 
                 dynamic and interactive web applications. React is known for 
                  its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to build complex user  
                 interfaces by breaking them down into reusable, self-contained components.</p>

                AngularJS, often referred to simply as Angular, is a powerful open-source JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. 
                It was originally developed by Google but is now maintained by the Angular team at Google. Angular is a comprehensive framework that 
                provides a set of tools and best practices for developing client-side web applications.

            <p>
                MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that is designed for storing and retrieving large
                 volumes of data quickly and efficiently. It is known for its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, 
                 making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale, high-traffic databases. Here's an introduction to MongoDB:</p>
